<p><span >If you are a Registered User and do not log into the Website using a third-party login provider (e.g., Facebook), you will be prompted to create an account, which includes a sign-in name (“Sign-In Name”), a password (“Password”), and perhaps certain additional information that will assist in authenticating your identity when you log-in in the future (“Unique Identifiers”). When creating your account, you must provide true, accurate, current, and complete information. Each Sign-In Name and corresponding Password can be used by only one Registered User. You are solely responsible for the confidentiality and use of your Sign-In Name, Password, and Unique Identifiers, as well as for any use, misuse, or communications entered or payments made through the Website using one or more of them. You will promptly inform us of any need to deactivate a Password or Sign-In Name, or change any Unique Identifier. We reserve the right to delete or change your Password, Sign-In Name, or Unique Identifier at any time and for any reason. Our collection and use of your personal information is governed by our </span><span >Privacy Policy.</span></p>
<strong><span >4. RETAIL PURCHASES</span></strong>
<p><span >You can make retail purchases of third-party goods (“Products”) through the Imprint Shop. Products may include Imprint-branded products. ALL PRODUCTS, EVEN IMPRINT-BRANDED PRODUCTS, ARE MANUFACTURED BY OR ON BEHALF OF THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS, AND NOT BY OR ON BEHALF OF IMPRINT; THEREFORE, IMPRINT HAS NO CONTROL OVER THE QUALITY, SAFETY, LEGALITY OR EFFICACY OF ANY PRODUCT AND ASSUMES NO LIABILITY WITH RESPECT TO ANY PRODUCT.</span></p>
<p><span >If you purchase any Products, the following terms and conditions apply:</span></p>
<ul>
<li ><span >As consideration for any purchase you make on the Website, you shall pay Imprint all applicable fees and taxes. We (or our third-party payment processor) shall authorize your credit card, bank account, or other approved payment facility you provided during the registration process for the full payment of the fees and any applicable taxes, and you hereby consent to the same. All payments will be charged and made in U.S. dollars.</span></li>
<li ><span >You must provide current, complete, and accurate billing and credit card information. You must promptly update all billing information (such as billing address, card number, and expiration date) to keep your account current, complete, and accurate, and you must promptly contact us if your credit card is lost or stolen, or if you become aware of a potential breach of account security (such as an unauthorized disclosure or use of your Sign-In Name or Password). You hereby authorize Imprint to obtain or determine updated or replacement expiration dates for your credit card in the event that the credit card you provided us expires. We reserve the right to charge any renewal card issued to you to the same extent as the expired card. If payment is not received from your credit card issuer, you hereby agree to pay all amounts due upon demand. You agree to pay all costs of collection, including attorney’s fees and costs, on any outstanding balance. In certain instances, the issuer of your credit card may charge you a foreign transaction fee or related charges, which you will be responsible to pay. You are advised to check with your bank and credit card issuer for details.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span >Imprint is a platform that sells original, one-of-a-kind art pieces from master craftspeople. All items are handmade, and as such, we are not currently able to accept returns, except for damaged items. </span></p>
<p>If you would like to contact us regarding your order, please email hello@imprintspace.com within 30 days of receiving your order. Please note if an item is accepted for return, refunds will be provided in the form of Imprint Shop credit, minus the cost of return shipping, and some items may be subject to a restocking fee. Thank you—from both Imprint and our makers worldwide—for your understanding.</p>
<p><span >If you receive a damaged item, please contact us within 30 days of receiving your order at hello@imprintspace.com with your name, order number and photos of the damage—we’ll straighten this out right away!</span></p>
<p><span >If you need something quickly, many of our products are also eligible for express shipping for an additional charge. You can see if your product has this service available by clicking “Shipping options &amp; delivery estimate” on the product page.</span></p>
<p>If something is particularly heavy, bulky, comes in an especially cumbersome package, is perishable, or ships from another country, we’ll note an extra surcharge on the product page and at checkout.</p>
<p><span >We currently ship within the U.S., to all 50 states. We hope to offer international shipping sometime in the future. For items ordered that are created by U.S. craftspeople, most of the products will ship UPS Ground and you’ll receive an email with tracking information within a couple hours after shipment. Once a package is on its way to you via standard shipping, it will arrive within 1 to 5 business days. For items shipped to U.S. customers from international craftspeople, we offer International shipping through recognized international couriers, which could take around 2-3 weeks to reach you. Should your order necessitate expedited shipping, there are options for you to request Priority Mail options for an additional fee.</span></p>
<strong><span >5. SERVICE PURCHASES</span></strong>
<p><span >To the extent the Service or any portion thereof is made available for any fee, you will be required to select a payment plan and provide Imprint information regarding your credit card. You will promptly update your account information with any changes (for example, a change in your billing address or credit card expiration date) that may occur. You agree to pay Imprint the amount that is specified in the payment plan (as well as any applicable taxes) in accordance with the terms of such plan and this Terms of Service. You hereby authorize Imprint to bill your credit card in accordance with the terms of the applicable payment plan (as well as any applicable taxes) until you terminate your account, and you further agree to pay any charges so incurred. If you dispute any charges you must let Imprint know within sixty (60) days after the date that Imprint charges you. We reserve the right to change Imprint’s prices. Your continued use of the Service after the price change becomes effective constitutes your agreement to pay the changed amount. You shall be responsible for all taxes associated with the Services other than U.S. taxes based on Imprint’s net income.</span></p>
<p><span >If you select a Service with an auto renewal feature (“Recurring Subscription”), you authorize Imprint to maintain your account information and charge that account automatically upon the renewal of the Service you choose with no further action required by you. In the event that Imprint is unable to charge your account as authorized by you when you enrolled in a Recurring Subscription, Imprint, may, in its sole discretion: (i) bill you for your Service and suspend your access to the Service until payment is received, and/or (ii) seek to update your account information through third party sources (i.e., your bank or a payment processor) to continue charging your account as authorized by you.</span></p>
<p><span >Imprint may change the price for Recurring Subscriptions from time to time and will communicate any price changes to you in advance and, if applicable, how to accept those changes. Price changes for Recurring Subscriptions will take effect at the start of the next subscription period following the date of the price change. As permitted by local law, you accept the new price by continuing to use your Recurring Subscription after the price change takes effect. If you do not agree with the price changes, you have the right to reject the change by cancelling your Recurring Subscription before the price change goes into effect. Please therefore make sure you read any such notification of price changes carefully.</span></p>
<p>Payments are nonrefundable and there are no refunds or credits for partially used periods. You may cancel a Recurring Subscription at any time, but if you cancel your subscription before the end of the current subscription period, we will not refund any subscription fees already paid to us. Following any cancellation, however, you will continue to have access to the service through the end of your current subscription period. At any time, and for any reason, we may provide a refund, discount, or other consideration to some or all of our users ("credits"). The amount and form of such credits, and the decision to provide them, are at our sole and absolute discretion. The provision of credits in one instance does not entitle you to credits in the future for similar instances, nor does it obligate us to provide credits in the future, under any circumstance.</p>
<p><span >If you purchase any Service through a mobile purchase or third-party marketplace (e.g., through the Apple App Store or Google Play Store), the refund policy applicable to that third-party marketplace will apply, unless otherwise explicitly stated by Imprint. Except as otherwise explicitly stated by Imprint, the third-party marketplace will be solely responsible for making refunds under its refund policy, and Imprint will have no refund obligations. Imprint disclaims any responsibility or liability related to any third-party marketplace's refund policy or the third party's compliance or noncompliance with such policy.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><span >If you subscribed on our website, you can cancel your subscription by contacting </span><a href="mailto:hello@imprintspace.com"><span >hello@imprintspace.com</span></a><span > and providing your name and a reason why you would like to cancel your account. </span></p>
